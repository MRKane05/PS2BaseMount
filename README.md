This is a dump of the KiCad project for the Junkstation PS2 project I made a few years ago. I'm really just backing it up for prosperity. 
I'm taking no responsibility for this and it really should be used only as reference.

It's worth noting that there are a couple of mistakes on the board that I haven't fixed:
-The Ethernet wiring for the Mango isn't correct, and troubleshooting it was exceedingly difficult, so much so that I didn't write it down when I got it right, I just put the lid on it
-The Ethernet lines for the Mango shouldn't be pulled down to Ground but pulled to the "R0" pin on the Mango. This allows a successful ethernet connection
-The SD Card slot wired up for game loading through the memory card port is correctly wired
